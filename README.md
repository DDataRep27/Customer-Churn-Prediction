# Customer-Churn-Prediction
* Companies usually have a greater focus on customer acquisition and keep retention as a secondary priority. However, it can cost five times more to attract a new customer than it does to retain an existing one. Increasing customer retention rates by 5% can increase profits by 25% to  95%, according to research done by Bain & Company.



# Problem Statement
** In this project, we will examine the data and create a machine learning algorithm that will detect if the customer would churn or not with the help of various features like 'Contract', 'InternetService', 'MultipleLines', 'TotalCharges' and 'tenure', etc. by using different classifiers.**
